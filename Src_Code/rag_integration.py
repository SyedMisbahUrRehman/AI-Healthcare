        Hello {patient_data.get('Name')}, this report is designed to help you understand your recent vital signs and what they might mean for your health. Our goal is to give you clear information and practical next steps.

        1. Explanation of Your Results & Risk Level
        Based on the information we have, your results indicate a Moderate to High Risk that warrants attention.

        In simple terms, your body is showing signs of working harder than it should to pump blood throughout your body. We see this primarily in your elevated blood pressure. When this is consistently high, it can put extra strain on your heart and blood vessels over time. We have categorized your risk as moderate to high because addressing this now is important for protecting your long-term health.

        2. What This Could Mean (Possible Diagnosis)
        It's important to remember that this is not a formal diagnosis, but a assessment based on your current numbers. The pattern of your vitals is most commonly associated with Primary Hypertension (High Blood Pressure).

        This is a very common condition where the long-term force of blood against your artery walls is high enough that it may eventually cause health problems. The good news is that it is often manageable with lifestyle adjustments and, if needed, medication.

        3. Your Suggested Next Steps
        Your health is a partnership, and there are clear actions we can take together. Here is what we recommend:

        Schedule a Follow-Up Appointment: Please book an appointment with your primary care provider to discuss these findings in detail. This is the most important next step. They will likely want to check your blood pressure again to confirm the reading.

        Monitor at Home: If your provider agrees, you might consider monitoring your blood pressure at home. We can advise you on how to choose a reliable monitor and how to take accurate readings.

        Lifestyle Considerations: There are powerful steps you can take to support your heart health:

        Diet: Reducing sodium (salt) intake can have a significant positive impact.

        Activity: Incorporating gentle, regular exercise like brisk walking can help strengthen your heart.

        Stress: Exploring stress-reduction techniques such as deep breathing or meditation can be beneficial.

        We are here to support you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need help scheduling your next appointment. Taking proactive steps now is a powerful way to invest in your future well-being.
